        <div class="def kid hidden">
            <p>A style of boxer who lacks the speed and mobility of a pure boxer and
            the strength and power of a slugger, however he blends the two styles to be able to
            compete strongly with either style. While it's possible for them to be outboxed by
            a superior boxer or overwhelmed by the power of a slugger he tends to do well against
            swarmers, whose natural kryptonite are generally sluggers. The power of a boxer puncher as
            well as his mobility allows him to potentially break down swarmers, can confuse and frustrate
            sluggers with their mobility, and overpower pure boxers with their power and ability to move fast
            enough to cut off the ring.</p>

            <p class="text-center font-weight-bold"><i>Popular boxer-punchers include: Joe Louis, Anthony Joshua, Lennox Lewis and Terrence Crawford*</i></p>

    <h2 class="text-center">Brawler</h2>

    <div>
        <p>An aesthetically rough style of boxing, sometimes referred to as ‘dirty boxing’. Most notably
        used by the likes of Jack Johnson and Roberto Duran, brawlers tend to be aggressive and fight
        on the inside, using their superior strength to wrestle and punish their opponents in the clinch
        using hand traps sneaky uppercuts, savage body work, collar ties and over/underhooks to control
        their opponents and break their body and spirit. They tend to do well against swarmers because of their
        ability to smother and control their opponent they tend not to fair so well against pure boxers that can adjust
        or clinch well but also have the ability to dominate boxers if they can't adjust or maintain their rhythm.</p>

        <p class="text-center font-weight-bold"><i>Popular brawlers include: Roberto Duran, Derek Chisora, Henry Armstrong</i></p>
    </div>

    <h2>Catch-and-Shoot</h2>

    <div>
        <p>A crowd friendly style used by the likes of Dillian Whyte, where the boxer depends on his guard
        to block and catch punches and return fire before the opponent can return to guard. Used mostly
        by close range fighters who have little to no time to avoid or parry incoming blows.</p>

        <p class="text-center font-weight-bold"><i>
            Popular fighters that utilize this style include Evander Holyfield, Oscar Valdez, Antonio Margarito</i></p>

    <h2 class="text-center">Counter-Puncher</h2>

    <div>
        <p>Controls the fight by timing his punches after, during, or right before his opponent throws a punch.
        Counter punchers tend to slow the fight pace down and pot shot their opponents. There are many
        different styles of Counter punchers and can be found in any and all stances and even different
        styles, some counter punchers prefer to fight on the outside waiting for their opponents to come in
        and others prefer to apply pressure and force their opponents to throw punches that they can then
        counter.</p>

        <p class="text-center font-weight-bold"><i>
            Popular counter punchers include: Floyd Mayweather, Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez, Juan Manuel Marquez

        <div>
            <p>The purest boxing style popularized by Muhammad Ali. The pure boxer depends on his footwork
            and accuracy to snipe and overwhelm his opponent with clean scoring punches. While they
            generally lack power; either due to depending on their mobility and hence, can’t properly
            “sit down” on their punches or they developed a pure boxing style to compensate for their
            lack of natural ability to hurt their opponents, they depend on frustrating their opponents
            and dragging them to the finish line, forcing their opponents to expend energy by missing
            power shots and chasing the boxer from post to post. Pure boxers are generally referred to
            as out-fighters however some pure boxers can fight on the 'inside' or 'outside'.</p>

            <p class="text-center font-weight-bold"><i>

    <h2 class="text-center">Slugger</h2>

    <div>
        <p>
        Another crowd friendly style, used notably by George Foreman. The slugger is a boxer with
        tremendous power, they generally lack hand speed or the ability to throw combinations.
        Resigned to throwing one or two shots at a time, they break down their opponents any time
        they land a single shot. You can never count a slugger out; they possess the power to knock
        out their opponent at any time. Stylistically their weakness tend to be pure boxers who outscore and
        tire out the slugger, sapping their power and avoiding their best punches.</p>

        <p class="text-center font-weight-bold"><i>
            Popular sluggers include: George Foreman, Deontay Wilder, Wisaksil Wangek
        </i></p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2 class="text-center">Swarmer</h2>

    <div class="def hidden">
        <p>A crowd friendly style of boxing where the boxer closes the distance to overwhelm his opponent
        with combinations. Naturally the kryptonite of pure boxers because the storm of punches disrupts
        their rhythm and outscores their conservative pot shotting or counterpunching style. An adage by
        most swarmers is to take one punch to land two or three.</p>

        <p class="text-center font-weight-bold"><i>
            Popular swarmers include: Manny Pacquiao, Shawn Porter, Vasily Lomanchenko*
        </i></p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-center">Switch-Hitter</h2>

    <div class="def hidden">
        <p>A rare but dangerous boxing style, used notably by Terrence Crawford, Jaron Ennis and the late
        Marvelous Marvin Hagler. These boxers are dangerous in either the orthodox or Southpaw stance and
        generally possess power in both hands. They tend to be both ferocious and skilled in boxing on the
        outside or fighting on the inside, confusing and breaking down their opponents.</p>

        <p class="text-center font-weight-bold"><i>
            Popular switch-hitters include: 'Marvelous' Marvin Hagler, Terrence 'Bud' Crawford and Jaron 'Boots' Ennis</i></p>
