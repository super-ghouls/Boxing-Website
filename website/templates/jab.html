<div class="term hidden" id="jab"><h3>Jab - 1</h3></div>
    <div class="def hidden">
        The most important strike in boxing and arguably all combat sports. Thrown from the lead hand 
        in a straight line, it's the fastest and most direct strike. Its strength lies in its versatility
        and ability to be used while moving as well as its ability to stop your opponent from moving. 
        The basic jab is executed by extending the lead hand out in a straight line making sure your 
        shoulder comes up to protect the chin, ensuring full extension and hip rotation.

        the left.
